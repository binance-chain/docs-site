# Acknowledgements

Binance Chain has been through several iterations and evolutions, each time building upon work contributed by our amazing friends in the blockchain community. Being a blockchain company with the community at its core, we would like to acknowledge the outstanding work that we have been able to utilize to grow and evolve. We hope that what we have produced will serve as a starting point for more projects in the blockchain ecosystem.

Let's build the future together!

## Binance Dexathon

The Binance Dexathon concluded in September 2018, receiving prize-winning submissions from teams that sent in some really impressive projects. Our internal work on Binance Chain was taking place in parallel to this and we are delighted to say that everything we looked at helped to broaden our horizons and improve the final product.

## Tendermint and Cosmos

Our current implementation was built on forks of Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. We make use of a revised edition of Tendermint consensus and leverage its p2p networking logic, and Cosmos SDK features such as its "bank" is used for basic token transactions.

Projects of this kind are often forks of Bitcoin or are implementated as smart contracts running on platforms such as Ethereum. With a foundation of clean, well-structured code from Cosmos we were able to build on a codebase that we saw as a much cleaner and well thought out alternative. Many thanks to the Cosmos developers and its community for their work (and for being really helpful in our issues and pull requests!)
