* If you would like to have additional security you can create an individual pin for each of your wallets which is seperate from your local account password providing additional security. **(this is optional)**

* You will now need to confirm that you understand that you have to backup your 12 or 24 word seed, we recommend keeping your seed phrases offline and some where safe since the 12 or 24 word seed can be used to recover your wallet. **(Never share your seed with anyone, this includes the Infinity Wallet team or support)**

* Make a backup of the words on the screen, we recommend making a paper backup and not an online backup, if you ever lose access to your pc or forget your password you will need your 12 or 24 word seed to recover your wallet **(Keep these words secure and never share with anyone since with these words anyone would be able to access your wallet)**

* Confirm 4 of the words in the correct order as request to generate your wallet

## Connect to DeFi Platforms and Dapps

The Infinity Wallet supports the ability for users to connect their Infinity Wallet securley to decentralized application on the Binance Smart Chain, Binance Chain and Ethereum. 

To connect your wallet make sure the platform you are connecting to supports *Wallet Connect**, then go to your Infinity Wallet and click in the bottom left corner **Wallet Connect**

 * In the popup that will show you can select one of 3 options to connect, the recomended and easiest option will be to use the 3rd option "**Desktop Scan**" which uses our drag and scan desktop technology.

 * Drag and resize the desktop qr scanner over the QR you want to scan, in this case we will be connecting to Infinity Crypto (https://infinitycrypto.com/)

 * Approve the connection between the platform and the wallet, this does not share access to your wallet and will require you to confirm every transaction on the platform within your Infinity Wallet. All transactions on the platform will be pushed to be signed within the Infinity Wallet ensuring your keys are never shared and maximum security while interacting with DeFi and Dapps.

NOTE: In the future we look to make it a lot faster for users to onboard with a fast onboarding option allowing to get into the application within 2 clicks, we are also working on the Infinity Wallet for mobile focusing more on day to day use with further features and advancements. We also look to provide in the future new ways for users to create different type of wallets such as cloud wallets, online wallets and social wallets, as well as support for hardware wallets.
