### Setup a Username for Cloud Contact Functionality & Password

It's important to setup a strong password as this will be used as a backup authentication method should you not have biometrics on your device. The Username is also important as it is unchangeable. We use your username to implement cloud contacts, where users will be able to send you BSC (or any other available coin in Black Wallet via your username instead of address).
