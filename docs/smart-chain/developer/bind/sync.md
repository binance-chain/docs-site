# Sync BEP2 and BEP20 Token Supply

> Note: this feature is only available in Testnet after Lagrange Upgrade


## Prerequisit

This BEP20 token is [mirrored](./mirror.md) to a BEP2 token.

## Motivation

For a BEP20 token that has been mirrored to BC, anyone can call the `sync` method to balance the total supply on BC and BSC. Thus, the total supply among two blockchain will remain the same.

## What happen under the hood

- Verify there is already mirrored
- Check the total supply and token symbol is valid
- Send a cross-chain package to modify a BEP2 token total supply on Binance Chain


After syncing, the total circulation is the same.


## Fee Table

Transaction Type  | Pay in BNB |
-- | -- |

Transfer Out Relayer Fee|0.01|

## Mirror With MyEtherWallet

- Call `Tokenmanager` Contract

Use the latest [ABI](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-genesis-contract/blob/master/abi/tokenmanager.abi )

- Select `sync` function and fill-in with your BEP20 address

The value here should be no less than  `syncFee`+ `Transfer Out Relayer Fee`. Besides, `syncFee` can be changed by on-chain governance

Time stamp should be greater than `unix_timestamp(now())`. The difference is between 120 and 86400. It's recommended to use `unix_timestamp(now())+1000`
