# BSC Relayer Guides

## Prepare Fund

1. Make sure that you have enough BNB in your account. You can get from [faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart)

> If you haven't created your account yet, please follow these [guides](../wallet/metamask.md) to create one first.
* 100:BNB for relayer register
* More than 50BNB for transaction fee

!!! Tip
		Currently the bsc-relayer code is not fully prepared. Some features like `db persistence`, `alert`, `prometheus monitor` are still under development. So please donâ€™t modify the configuration about db_config, alert_config, instrumentation_config, admin_config

## Steps to Install BSC Relayer

1.Build from source code

Make sure that you have installed [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/doc/install) and have added `GOPATH` to `PATH` environment variable

```bash
git clone -b v1.0.0-alpha.0 https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-relayer
# Enter the folder bsc was cloned into
cd bsc-relayer
# Comile and install bsc
make build
```

or you can download the pre-build binaries from [release page](https://github.com/binance-chain/smart-chain-binary/tree/master/bsc)

## Get Example Config File
Get example config from this url: <https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-relayer-config/blob/master/bsc/testnet/config.json>

Edit`config.json` and fill your BSC private key to bsc_config.private_key, example private key: `AFD8C5D83F148065176268A9D1EE375A10CEE1E74D15985D4CC63E467EC34DA5`


## Start Relayer

1. Start Locally

    ```shell script
    ./bsc-relayer --config-type local --config-path config.json
    ```

2. Dynamic Sync Cross Chain Protocol Configuration from <https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-relayer-config.git>

    * Edit config.json and change "cross_chain_config.protocol_config_type" to "remote". Then relayer will dynamically sync cross chain protocol configuration from this repository: https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-relayer-config.git
    * Start relayer service
    ```shell script
   ./bsc-relayer --config-type local --config-path config.json
    ````
