# Get Started with Binance Chain

## Wallet
The easiest way to use Binance Chain is through a wallet with support for Binance Chain accounts and transfers.

For example, Binance provides a Web Wallet at https://dex.binance.org, which provides the below functions:

- Generating crypto keys and addresses, which serves as the base of a wallet
- Showing the balances of assets on the addresses
- Sending and receiving assets

Binance Chain Web Wallet also presents a trading UI similar to Binance.com, where you can examine market data and manage your orders to trade among the listed assets.

There are also other wallets that support Binance Chain, with more to come in the future:

- [Hardware wallets](hardware-wallets.md)
- [Other software wallets](software-wallets.md)

## Chain Explorer
Chain Explorer provides a portal to explore blocks and transaction details. On Binance Chain Explorer, 
you can also check different types assets, the distribution of their ownerships, and owners' transactions.

## API
Similar to Binance.com, you can access Binance Chain and DEX via APIs. There are http REST APIs, Websocket interface for market data and user data, node rpc for transactions and blockchain information. Please refer to the [API Reference](api-reference/dex-api.md) for detailed specifications. For programmers interested in developing light wallets and other custom integrations, [SDKs](api-reference/sdk.md) are also provided as a starting point for your apps.
