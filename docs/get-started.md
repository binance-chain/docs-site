# Get Started with Binance Chain

## Wallet
The easiest way to use Binance Chain is through a wallet with support for Binance Chain accounts and transfers.

For example, Binance provides a Web Wallet at https://www.binance.org (https://testnet.binance.org for testnet), which provides the below functions:

- Generating crypto keys and addresses, which serves as the base of a wallet
- Showing the balances of assets on the addresses
- Sending and receiving assets

Binance Chain Web Wallet also presents a trading UI similar to Binance.com, where you can examine market data and manage your orders to trade among the listed assets.
